Overview
========

Working together with modelled and observational data sets can be challenging.
Modelled data sets can be very large, with each model populating data along a
different grid.  This package provides a variety of tools to aid model-data
analysis.  This includes tools for model validation, modelling instrument
output, and incorporating modelled data sets into general data analysis
routines written to use data stored in
`pysat.Instrument <https://pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#instrument>`_
objects or
`xarray.Datasets <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html>`_.
